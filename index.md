## About Me


![Profile picture]({{ '/assets/images/rumorsSMpic.png' | relative_url }})


 
My name is Ava Farkash, and I am a Mechanical Engineering student at Cornell University. In the Fall of 2024 I became a member of the mechanical subteam on Cornell University's Design Build Fly Project Team. Throughout my time on this team I have learned invaluable skills such as the principles of flight and aerodynamics, manufacturing various composites (notably and most often custom carbon fiber fabrication), inter-team communication and organization, and prototyping. I have been a member of Cog Dog Theater Troupe on campus since the Spring of 2024 and have acted as assisant technical director (Fall 2024-Spring 2025) and full technical director (Fall 2025) on the club's Executive Board. Participating in technical theater on campus continues to be one of my greatest passions and gives me space to enhance my non-stem pursuits. I am also a member of Cornell's chapter of Guiding Eyes for the Blind and have been a sitter since Fall 2025. I believe this volunteer organization has immensely contributed to my positive experiences and mindset at Cornell through the weekly act of dog-sitting.
