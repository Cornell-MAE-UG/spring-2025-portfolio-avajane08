title: MAE 3270 (Mechanics of Engineering Materials) Final Project
description: This assignment involves designing an instrumented 3/8-inch drive torque wrench capable of measuring 600 in-lbf of torque using bonded strain gauges. The work begins with analysis of a provided baseline design through both hand calculations and a finite element model in ANSYS, followed by iterative improvements through material selection, dimensional adjustments, and verification of all safety and performance requirements. A CAD model of the optimized wrench is then created and imported into ANSYS for full stress and strain analysis. The project integrates materials selection, stress and deflection analysis, fracture and fatigue safety factors, and FEM validation to demonstrate a complete first-cut mechanical design workflow.
