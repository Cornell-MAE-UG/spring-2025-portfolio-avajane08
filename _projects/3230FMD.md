title: MAE 3230 (Introductory Fluid Mechanics) Fluid Mechanical Dissection
description: This end of semester project required dissecting a given object, in my case a gas powered air blower, and examining its internal fluidic systems with a group. This project allowed me to explore fluid mechanical properties and basic fluid machines discussed in class and see how they work in reality. The end result of this project is a five minute detailed explanation of how our air blower works using descriptors and concepts from lecture. We also computed things like the Reynolds number of the outflow air from the dimensions gathered from our machine.
